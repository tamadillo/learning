I am learning to code and keeping my profile at
[tamadillo](https://github.com/tamadillo). My dad promised to take me to the
next [RailsCamp](https://rails.camp/), RailsCamp 23 in Queensland Australia, if
I learn to type and can write a program to write my name 100 times.

**How are you learning to type?**

  I am using a computer and Gtypist. My computer is a Rapberry Pi, or is a
  pasberry ras. I am using a special keyboard, a pok3r 3, it is much nicer then
  the really flat keyboards of a laptop.

**What made you interested in computers?**

  I wanted to be like dad, a computer programmer. I also wanted to go to a
  rails camp and play werewolf.

**Do you use computers at school?**

  No I go to a Steiner school and we do not use computers and are discouraged
  from even watching TV at home. I have just started in a computer club at
  school though. It is called *Inside The Brick - Girls STEM Club*.

**What do you do at the STEM club?**

  Some programming. I have written a story using HTML. I have sculpted things
  using a program called [sculptris](http://pixologic.com/sculptris/). Soon
  we will do some 3D printed name tags.

**What are you hoping to program by the end of this year, 2017?**

  An arduino flashing beanie or wristband which I can knit and program the
  lights.
